  <h1>Flipkart Clone Project - MERN Stack</h1>
  <p>This is a Flipkart clone project developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The project consists of two main folders: <code>client</code> and <code>server</code>, representing the front-end and back-end components respectively. Redux is used for state management, and Material-UI is utilized for building the user interface. The project is hosted on Netlify for the client-side and on another platform (e.g., Heroku) for the server-side.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Node.js (version >= 12)</li>
    <li>npm (Node Package Manager)</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>Clone the repository:</p>
  <pre>
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/flipkart-clone.git
  cd flipkart-clone
  </pre>

  <p>Install dependencies for both the client and server:</p>
  <pre>
  cd client
  npm install

  cd ../server
  npm install
  </pre>

  <h2>Development</h2>
  <p>Start the development server for the client (front-end):</p>
  <pre>
  cd client
  npm start
  </pre>
  <p>The client will run on <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.</p>

  <p>Start the development server for the server (back-end):</p>
  <pre>
  cd server
  npm start
  </pre>
  <p>The server will run on <code>http://localhost:5000</code>.</p>

  <h2>Deployment</h2>
  <p>The project has been deployed using Netlify for the client-side and another hosting platform (e.g., Heroku) for the server-side. To deploy the client on Netlify, you can follow the steps mentioned in the <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/#drag-and-drop">Netlify documentation</a>. Similarly, to deploy the server on another hosting platform, you need to set up the appropriate hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS, etc.) and configure the deployment process according to the platform's guidelines.</p>
